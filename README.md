If needed. Please feel free to contact me through git or Nextgenupdate for questions on code... coding this was a hard task for as my primary goal was to make the code editable for anybody to make there own game... I---I guess you can say i just made an engine with editable functions. This is just a fraction of what can be done. Animations, complex mesh/texture sorting with sprite sheets, and much more if your willing to edit the engine.
